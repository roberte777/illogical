//      local    a unix socket, one descriptor for both directions
//      remote   `ssh <dest> illogicald --stdio`, a pipe each way
//
//  That is the whole of the remote story on this side. No TLS, no listening
//  socket, no credential handling of ours: the user's existing SSH config,
//  keys, jump hosts and agent forwarding decide who may connect, and the far
//  end is src/daemon/stdio.zig splicing the pipe onto that host's own unix
//  socket. See docs/PROTOCOL.md, "Transport".
